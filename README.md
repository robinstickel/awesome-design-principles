### Credits and Notes
This list is heavily inspired by [Awesome Design Systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems) by Alex Pate. As an UX designer I find myself writing design and/or experience principles quite often. I created this list for reference and to get inspiration for better design principles.
